# Pirate Recipe

A little personal website for me and my friend's to upload our recipes.

The plan was to make it as bare-bones and simple as possible. No thrills, just recipes.

Was also looking for an excuse to test out Nextjs14 with supabase. I really got sucked into their motto: Build ~~in a weekend~~ on a Friday night! Scale to millions!
